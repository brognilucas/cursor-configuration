## Implementation Guidelines 

### Test First (TDD)
- Every new piece of code needs to have a test, meaning that when creating a new functionality TDD must be followed. 

### After every test that passes a commit must be done 

- After implementing a single test and making it pass, confirm if a commit must be done. 

## Classes Guidelines 

### Private properties should have name with _

- Private properties should be named following name: `_product`, `_price`, etc. 

### Public methods don't need to have get or set: 
- Public methods can be accessed using direct naming as: `product`, `price`
