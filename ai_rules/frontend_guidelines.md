## Testing 
- Read [Testing Guidelines](./testing_guidelines.md)
- Use React testing library for React applications 

## Use Container Presenter Pattern 
- Concept: Separate components into two types:
- Container (Smart): Handles data fetching, state, and logic.
- Presenter (Dumb): Handles UI rendering based on props.
- Put business logic and data fetching in injectable hooks 

## Avoid styled components
- Don't create styled components unless stated otherwise.
