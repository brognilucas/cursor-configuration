## Refactoring 

### Before refactoring a test should be in place 
- For a proper refactoring without breaking the existing behaviour the code must be tested. Before starting any refactor please check at the tests and if test is not covered create an integration test to cover it and follow TDD for the rest of the implementation. 

### Always confirm refactor Plan. 
- Never start a refactoring without confirming what wants to achieve with the refactoring.
